Integration and Prediction Tools for System Biology

This package propose automated pipelines to run logistic, linear and ordinal regressions on a dataset. 
It will generate a report with several graphics related to the type of the dependant variable and doing so related to the type of regression.

With a logistic regression, the report will contain:
